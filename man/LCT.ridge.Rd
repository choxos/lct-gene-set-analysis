\title{Linear Combination Test with Ridge Covariance Estimator}
\usage{
LCT.ridge(DATA, cl, nbPermutations = 1000, s0 = 0, lambda = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{DATA}{Expression data matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns.
Row names should be gene identifiers. Matrix should be numeric.}

\item{cl}{Phenotype vector defining group membership. Must be binary (two
levels). Can be numeric (0/1), factor, or character. Length must equal
number of columns in DATA.}

\item{nbPermutations}{Number of permutations for p-value calculation.
Default is 1000. See \code{\link{LCT.shrinkage}} for guidelines.}

\item{s0}{Small positive constant added to eigenvalues for numerical
stability. Default is 0.}

\item{lambda}{Ridge penalty parameter. Default is 1. Higher values impose
stronger regularization. Typical range: 0.1-10. For very high-dimensional
data, consider lambda = 5-10.}
}
\value{
Numeric p-value between 0 and 1 from the permutation test.
}
\description{
Performs the Linear Combination Test using ridge regularization (L2 penalty)
for covariance estimation. Recommended for unbalanced study designs where
group sizes differ substantially. Ridge regularization provides better Type I
error control in unbalanced scenarios compared to shrinkage.
}
\details{
Ridge regularization adds a penalty term λ to the diagonal of the covariance
matrix, ensuring positive definiteness and numerical stability. This is
particularly important for:
\itemize{
\item Unbalanced designs (e.g., 20 controls vs 5 cases)
\item High-dimensional data (genes >> samples)
\item Multicollinear gene expression patterns
}

The ridge estimator is:
\deqn{\hat{\Sigma}_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{1+\lambda}S + \frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda}I}
where S is the sample covariance matrix and I is the identity matrix.

\strong{Performance}: ~0.5-1 second per gene set (with 1000 permutations)

\strong{When to use}: Unbalanced designs, highly correlated genes
}
\note{
The lambda parameter can be tuned based on data characteristics. Start with
default (lambda = 1) and increase if numerical issues occur.

\examples{
# Example with unbalanced design
set.seed(456)
n_genes <- 50

# Create unbalanced groups (15 controls, 5 cases)
phenotype <- c(rep(0, 15), rep(1, 5))
n_samples <- length(phenotype)

# Create expression data
expression <- matrix(rnorm(n_genes * n_samples), nrow = n_genes)
rownames(expression) <- paste0("Gene", 1:n_genes)

# Add differential expression
expression[1:10, phenotype == 1] <- expression[1:10, phenotype == 1] + 1.5

# Run LCT with ridge estimator (better for unbalanced designs)
p_value <- LCT.ridge(expression, phenotype, nbPermutations = 1000, lambda = 1)
print(p_value)

\donttest{
# Compare different lambda values
p_lambda1 <- LCT.ridge(expression, phenotype, nbPermutations = 1000, lambda = 1)
p_lambda5 <- LCT.ridge(expression, phenotype, nbPermutations = 1000, lambda = 5)

# Higher lambda = more regularization
cat("Lambda = 1:", p_lambda1, "\n")
cat("Lambda = 5:", p_lambda5, "\n")
}
