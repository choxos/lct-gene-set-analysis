\usage{
LCT.adaptive.lasso(
  DATA,
  cl,
  nbPermutations = 1000,
  s0 = 0.5,
  lambda = 0.5,
  n = 0.8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{DATA}{Expression data matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns.
Row names should be gene identifiers. Matrix should be numeric.}

\item{cl}{Phenotype vector defining group membership. Must be binary (two
levels). Can be numeric (0/1), factor, or character. Length must equal
number of columns in DATA.}

\item{nbPermutations}{Number of permutations for p-value calculation.
Default is 1000.}

\item{s0}{Small positive constant added to eigenvalues for numerical
stability. Default is 0.5 (higher than other methods due to potential for
smaller eigenvalues).}

\item{lambda}{Penalty parameter for adaptive lasso. Default is 0.5. Controls
overall regularization strength. Typical range: 0.1-1.0.}

\item{n}{Adaptive weight exponent. Default is 0.8. Controls how weights are
computed: weights = (1/|initial_estimate|)^n. Higher n = more aggressive
penalization of small coefficients. Typical range: 0.5-1.0.}
}
\value{
Numeric p-value between 0 and 1 from the permutation test.
}
\description{
Performs the Linear Combination Test using the adaptive lasso for covariance
estimation. Adaptive lasso applies weighted L1 penalties that can achieve
oracle properties (consistent variable selection and asymptotically efficient
estimation). Useful when you want automatic feature selection along with
covariance estimation.
}
\details{
The adaptive lasso uses data-driven weights to penalize different covariance
elements differently:
\deqn{\hat{\Sigma} = \arg\min \{ ||S - \Sigma||_F^2 + \lambda \sum w_j |\sigma_j| \}}
where weights \eqn{w_j = 1/|\hat{\sigma}_j|^n} are based on an initial
estimate.

\strong{Advantages}:
\itemize{
\item Oracle properties (consistent selection + efficient estimation)
\item Automatic feature selection
\item Less biased than standard lasso for large coefficients
}

\strong{Disadvantages}:
\itemize{
\item Two tuning parameters (lambda and n)
\item Computationally slower than shrinkage (~1-2 sec per gene set)
\item Requires initial estimator (can be unstable for small samples)
}

\strong{Performance}: ~1-2 seconds per gene set (with 1000 permutations)

\strong{When to use}: Feature selection, oracle properties desired, moderate sample sizes
}
\note{
The adaptive lasso may be sensitive to the initial covariance estimate,
especially with small sample sizes. For very small samples (n < 30),
consider LCT.shrinkage or LCT.ridge instead.

\examples{
# Example with feature selection
set.seed(321)
n_genes <- 40
n_samples <- 30

# Create expression data with sparse effects
expression <- matrix(rnorm(n_genes * n_samples), nrow = n_genes)
rownames(expression) <- paste0("Gene", 1:n_genes)

# Only 5 genes are truly differentially expressed
phenotype <- c(rep(0, 15), rep(1, 15))
expression[1:5, phenotype == 1] <- expression[1:5, phenotype == 1] + 2

# Run LCT with adaptive lasso
p_value <- LCT.adaptive.lasso(expression, phenotype, nbPermutations = 1000,
                               lambda = 0.5, n = 0.8)
print(p_value)

\donttest{
# Compare different n values (weight exponent)
p_n05 <- LCT.adaptive.lasso(expression, phenotype, nbPermutations = 1000,
                             lambda = 0.5, n = 0.5)

                             lambda = 0.5, n = 1.0)
